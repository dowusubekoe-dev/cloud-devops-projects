# Ignore the .env file which contains sensitive environment variables
.env
# Ignore built Docker images/containers data (if any are saved locally)
# Though often not explicitly created in the repo, good to include.

# For Docker Compose, persistent volume data should be outside the repo
# and is usually managed by Docker volumes, but if any local mounts exist
# that shouldn't be tracked, list them here.
